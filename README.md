# Sales-Finance-Report-for-AtliQ-Hardware

AtliQ Hardware is stressed with Excel Files. Their Sales & Finnace Team are on Mission to get rid of these Excel Files. But remember not every excel file
can be replaced. Some Excel Files will remain. Also they are interested in data analytics. So Excel is a perfect gateway to onboard to analytics.

So as an aspiring Data Analyst, I have come up with some awesome reports on Sales and Finance Analytics.

Pipeline : 
Performed ETL -> Data Cleaning -> Data Modeling -> Created dim_date Table -> Connected dim_date to Data Model -> Performed DAX Formula
-> Created Report Using Power Pivot -> Conditional Formatting -> Made User Empathetic Report Design

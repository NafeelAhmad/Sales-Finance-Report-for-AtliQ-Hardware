# Sales-Finance-Report-for-AtliQ-Hardware

AtliQ Hardware is stressed with Excel Files. Their Sales & Finance Teams are on a Mission to eliminate these Excel Files. But remember not every Excel file
can be replaced. Some Excel Files will remain. Also, they are interested in data analytics. So Excel is a perfect gateway to onboard to analytics.

So as an aspiring Data Analyst, I have come up with some awesome Sales and Finance Analytics reports.

**Pipeline:**
Performed ETL -> Data Cleaning -> Data Modeling -> Created dim_date Table -> Connected dim_date to Data Model -> Performed DAX Formula
-> Created Report Using Power Pivot -> Conditional Formatting -> Made User Empathetic Report Design

Finally, I came up with Different Reports Like Customer Net Sales Performance report, Market Performance Report VS Target, Sales report for the Indian Market,
P & L Year for Different Markets & GM% by Quarters of Different Sub Zones.
